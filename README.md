# **SpendWise: AI-Powered Personal & Group Expense Manager**  

## **Problem Statement**  
Managing personal and group expenses is often tedious and error-prone, especially when dealing with:  
- **Large groups** where manual splitting becomes complicated  
- **Uneven expense distributions** (e.g., "Alice paid $100, but Bob only had a $20 meal")  
- **Lack of real-time insights** into spending habits  
- **Difficulty tracking budgets** and savings goals  
- **Manual reconciliation** of shared expenses  

**Current solutions (spreadsheets, basic apps) fail** because:  
‚ùå They require **manual calculations** for splits  
‚ùå They don‚Äôt handle **percentage-based or custom splits** easily  
‚ùå They lack **AI assistance** for natural language inputs  

**SpendWise solves this** with an **AI-driven expense manager** that:  
‚úî **Automatically splits group expenses** (equal, percentage, or custom) via natural language  
‚úî **Tracks personal budgets** with AI categorization  
‚úî **Uses facial recognition** for instant balance checks  
‚úî **Simplifies debt settlements** with smart suggestions
